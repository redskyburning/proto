					<p>"Lik sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand  a man, or woman, or child. Yes, my boy, all those people lived right  here in San Francisco. And at one time or another all those people  came out on this very beach&mdash;more people than there are grains of sand.  More&mdash;more&mdash;more. And San Francisco was a noble city. And across the  bay&mdash;where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from Point  Richmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to  San Leandro&mdash;one great city of seven million people.&mdash;Seven teeth...  there, that's it, seven millions."</p>

					<p>Again the boys' eyes ranged up and down from Edwin's fingers to the  teeth on the log.</p>

					<p>"The world was full of people. The census of 2010 gave eight billions  for the whole world&mdash;eight crab-shells, yes, eight billions. It was not  like to-day. Mankind knew a great deal more about getting food. And the  more food there was, the more people there were. In the year 1800, there  were one hundred and seventy millions in Europe alone. One hundred years  later&mdash;a grain of sand, Hoo-Hoo&mdash;one hundred years later, at 1900, there  were five hundred millions in Europe&mdash;five grains of sand, Hoo-Hoo, and  this one tooth. This shows how easy was the getting of food, and how men  increased. And in the year 2000 there were fifteen hundred millions  in Europe. And it was the same all over the rest of the world. Eight  crab-shells there, yes, eight billion people were alive on the earth  when the Scarlet Death began.</p>

					<p>"I was a young man when the Plague came&mdash;twenty-seven years old; and I  lived on the other side of San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley. You remember  those great stone houses, Edwin, when we came down the hills from Contra  Costa? That was where I lived, in those stone houses. I was a professor  of English literature."</p>

					<p>Much of this was over the heads of the boys, but they strove to  comprehend dimly this tale of the past.</p>

					<p>"What was them stone houses for?" Hare-Lip queried.</p>

					<p>"You remember when your dad taught you to swim?" The boy nodded.  "Well, in the University of California&mdash;that is the name we had for  the houses&mdash;we taught young men and women how to think, just as I have  taught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people  lived in those days. There was very much to teach. The young men and  women we taught were called students. We had large rooms in which we  taught. I talked to them, forty or fifty at a time, just as I am talking  to you now. I told them about the books other men had written before  their time, and even, sometimes, in their time&mdash;"</p>

					<p>"Was that all you did?&mdash;just talk, talk, talk?" Hoo-Hoo demanded. "Who  hunted your meat for you? and milked the goats? and caught the fish?"</p>

					<p>"A sensible question, Hoo-Hoo, a sensible question. As I have told you,  in those days food-getting was easy. We were very wise. A few men got  the food for many men. The other men did other things. As you say, I  talked. I talked all the time, and for this food was given me&mdash;much  food, fine food, beautiful food, food that I have not tasted in sixty  years and shall never taste again. I sometimes think the most wonderful  achievement of our tremendous civilization was food&mdash;its inconceivable  abundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. O my  grandsons, life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful  things to eat."</p>

					<p>This was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts,  as a mere senile wandering in the narrative.</p>
